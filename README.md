# VoiceAttack Profile for SpaceEngine
**Use this VoiceAttack profile to control SpaceEngine with your voice.**  
**VoiceAttack for $10 is required, try the trial first**

---
## Intro
This repository contains an English VoiceAttack profile with about **50 commands (well over 1000 combinations)** for controlling SpaceEngine using your voice.

This is probably especially useful in VR or if you're not quick with the keyboard, I've found it to be very convenient when exploring on a screen, too. Another idea would be to let other people in the room control SpaceEngine to go to objects or toggle overlays.

## Examples
A few examples of what you can now say:

- `select <object>`
- `go to object`
- `go to current location`
- `set time to now`
- `set time speed`
- `set date <date>`
- `set velocity`
- `set star magnitude to <integer>`
- `show/hide star names`
- `show/hide constellations`
- `show/hide interface`
- `show/hide procedural objects`
- `show/hide clouds`  
... and lots more

You can also say `show commands` or `show command reference` to display a complete command reference after having imported the profile.

## Installing the profile
1. Purchase, download, install and start VoiceAttack.
2. Download the latest .vax file under [releases](https://github.com/jamesmule/VAPforSE/releases).
3. Copy the .vax file into VoiceAttack's import folder at `C:\Program Files (x86)\VoiceAttack\Apps\Import` or `C:\Program Files\VoiceAttack\Apps\Import` and launch VoiceAttack.

4. If you haven't done so already, you will most likely have to train your Windows Speech Recognition engine, so VoiceAttack can understand your accent and pronunciation better. This will take maybe 15 minutes and will require you to speak sentences into your microphone that Windows shows on the screen.

5. Voil√†, there you go. You can now say `Start SpaceEngine` and SE should launch.

## About VoiceAttack
Using VoiceAttack, you can define your own voice commands or macros that can execute all kinds of actions, from launching your programs in Windows to deploying your weapons in Elite:Dangerous.

If you don't have VoiceAttack but are interested, it is available for $10 on [their website](https://voiceattack.com/) and for $12 [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/583010/VoiceAttack/) (unless there's a 25% sale).

It's recommended you try out the free trial version with a limited feature set first to avoid encountering compatibility issues once you've already bought the program.
